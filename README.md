# eRent

A comprehensive property rental management system built with .NET Core backend and Flutter frontend applications.

## 📱 Applications

The eRent system consists of three Flutter applications:

1. **Desktop Admin App** (`erent_desktop`) - Administrative interface for system management
2. **Landlord Desktop App** (`erent_landlord_desktop`) - Property management interface for landlords
3. **Mobile App** (`erent_mobile`) - Mobile application for regular users to browse and rent properties

## 🔐 Test Login Credentials

### Desktop Admin App
- **Username:** `desktop` (pre-filled)
- **Password:** `test` (pre-filled)

### Landlord Desktop App
- **Username:** `landlord` (pre-filled)
- **Password:** `test` (pre-filled)

### Mobile App
- **Username:** `user` (pre-filled)
- **Password:** `test` (pre-filled)

> **Note:** All login forms in the mobile app come with pre-filled test credentials for easy testing.

## 📧 Email Notifications

### Landlord Notification Email
The system uses the following email account for sending notifications to landlords:

- **Email:** `test.vedadnuhic@gmail.com`
- **Password:** `!testinfo123!`

This email account is configured for the landlord user (User ID: 2) and receives email notifications for various rent-related events.

### When Notifications Are Sent

Email notifications are automatically sent in the following scenarios:

1. **Pending** - When a user creates a new rent request
   - **Recipient:** Landlord
   - **Subject:** "New Rent Request - [Property Title]"

2. **Cancelled** - When a user cancels a rent request (from Pending or Accepted status)
   - **Recipient:** Landlord
   - **Subject:** "Rent Cancelled - [Property Title]"

3. **Accepted** - When a landlord accepts a rent request
   - **Recipient:** User (tenant)
   - **Subject:** "Rent Request Accepted - [Property Title]"

4. **Rejected** - When a landlord rejects a rent request
   - **Recipient:** User (tenant)
   - **Subject:** "Rent Request Rejected - [Property Title]"

5. **Paid** - When a user completes payment for an accepted rent
   - **Recipient:** Landlord
   - **Subject:** "Payment Received - [Property Title]"

### Notification System Architecture

The notification system uses:
- **RabbitMQ** for message queuing
- **eRent.Subscriber** service that listens for rent notifications
- **Gmail SMTP** for sending HTML email notifications
- Asynchronous processing to avoid blocking rent operations
